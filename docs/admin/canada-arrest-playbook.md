# Canada Arrest Playbook (Police Operational)

A statute-grounded operational reference for Canadian peace officers. Aligns with the **Criminal Code** and **Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms** for field-ready deployment.

---

## 1. Legal Grounds to Arrest (No Warrant)
- **Criminal Code s.495(1)** — Peace officers may arrest without warrant when they have reasonable grounds the individual:
  - Committed, is committing, or is about to commit an indictable offence
  - Is found committing any Criminal Code offence
  - Is subject to an arrest warrant in force within the jurisdiction
- **Release Bias ("Ladder")** — Decisions under Part XVI must prioritize release at the earliest reasonable opportunity on the least onerous conditions (**s.493.1**).

## 2. Rights on Arrest or Detention (Charter s.10)
- Inform promptly of:
  1. **s.10(a) — Reasons for arrest/detention**
  2. **s.10(b) — Right to retain and instruct counsel without delay**, followed by a meaningful opportunity to exercise that right

### Pocket Scripts (Use verbatim/near-verbatim; copy to notebook)
- **s.10(a) Reason**  
  `"I am arresting/detaining you for: [offence + brief facts, date/place]."`
- **s.10(b) Counsel**  
  `"It is my duty to inform you that you have the right to retain and instruct counsel in private, without delay. You may call any lawyer you want. There is a 24-hour duty-counsel service that can give you free legal advice. If you wish to contact a duty lawyer, I can provide the number. Do you understand?"`

**Practice Note:** Document the time rights were provided, all questions asked, confirmation of understanding, and calls placed (duty counsel or private) consistent with s.10(b) jurisprudence.

## 3. Use of Force
- **Criminal Code s.25** — Officers acting lawfully may use as much force as is reasonably necessary.
- Lethal or grievous-bodily-harm force only within narrow circumstances (see subsections incl. **s.25(5)**).
- Always articulate necessity and proportionality in reports.

## 4. Search Powers (Post-Arrest)
- **Search Incident to Arrest (SITAR)** — A limited common-law power focused on:
  - Officer and public safety
  - Preventing escape
  - Preserving evidence
- Scope may extend to immediate surroundings and vehicles when reasonable.
- **Key cases**: *R. v. Caslake* and *R. v. Fearon* (stricter conditions for device searches).
- Document grounds, scope, and findings for all searches.
- Quick refreshers: Criminal Notebook arrest/search digests are effective roll-call supplements.

## 5. Release & Compelling Attendance
- If not arresting under **s.495(2)**, issue an **appearance notice (s.497)**.
- When arresting without warrant:
  - Default to release as soon as practicable via summons, appearance notice, or undertaking unless public-interest grounds demand detention (**s.498 & s.498(1.1)**).
  - Apply the **s.493.1 release principle** before imposing conditions or detaining.
- Reference service policies on undertakings and release instruments.

## Arrest Checklist (Field Use)
1. **Grounds** — Record facts establishing reasonable grounds (who/what/where/when/how).
2. **Control & Safety** — Identify, declare arrest, secure hands, apply cuffs per training.
3. **Charter s.10** — Deliver reason and counsel caution; confirm understanding; facilitate counsel contact.
4. **Search Incident** — Conduct pat-down and search immediate area; seize evidence; log precise locations.
5. **Transport** — Advise destination; monitor detainee welfare.
6. **Booking** — Capture photos/prints; inventory property; complete medical check.
7. **Release Decision** — Apply s.493.1; consider s.497/s.498 options; document reasons for detention.
8. **Report** — Full narrative covering grounds, cautions (with times/wording), counsel calls, searches, force (s.25), evidence, and witnesses.
