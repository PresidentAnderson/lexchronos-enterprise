# LexChronos PWA Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality of LexChronos on iOS and Android devices.

## Pre-Testing Setup

### Development Server
1. Start the development server:

## Support Information

For PWA-related issues:
1. Check browser compatibility
2. Verify HTTPS is enabled
3. Test on real devices, not just simulators
4. Monitor service worker lifecycle
5. Check network conditions
6. Validate manifest file
7. Test with different user permissions

Remember: PWA features require HTTPS in production and may have different behavior in development vs. production environments.
